-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor. It backs Bridge's LaunchPad
-- push (bridge-view.js: _syncItemToLaunchPadCore()) for the case where an
-- activity's date changes and its row therefore needs a new day-encoded id
-- (LaunchPad's own id scheme bakes the date into the id itself — see
-- launchPadNumericId() in bridge-view.js — so a date change can't be a
-- plain same-row UPDATE; it has to become a different row).
--
-- Before this function existed, that was two separate round-trips from the
-- browser (upsert the new row, then delete the old one). Each step could
-- succeed or fail independently — a dropped connection, a closed tab, or
-- two overlapping moves between those two calls could leave the new row
-- written but the old one never cleaned up, which is exactly the "moved,
-- but the old one is still there" bug. Wrapping both writes in one plpgsql
-- function makes Postgres run them as a single transaction: either the new
-- row lands AND the old one is removed, or neither happens — there's no
-- window where only half of the move can be observed.
--
-- SECURITY INVOKER (the default — deliberately not DEFINER): this runs
-- with the CALLING role's own permissions, so it can only do what that
-- role could already do by calling insert/update/delete directly — no
-- privilege escalation. Row Level Security on the target table still
-- applies exactly as it would without this function. The table-name
-- allowlist check below is an extra guard specifically because the table
-- name is a parameter (dynamic per project, "{PROJECT_KEY}BackEndData") —
-- it only accepts names that already match that naming convention.
