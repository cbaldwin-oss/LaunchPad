-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor before the sync workflow's
-- first run. It creates two small cache tables that hold the latest
-- snapshot of data that's still actually maintained in Google Sheets
-- (equipment status rows + Phase Rules, and the dashboard's rollup data),
-- pulled in periodically by sync/sync-equipment-data.mjs instead of the
-- app calling the slow Apps Script endpoint live on every page load.
--
-- Writes come only from the sync job, authenticated with the Supabase
-- service_role key (which bypasses RLS) — never from the browser. Reads
-- come from the app's anon key, same as every other launchpad_* table.
-- Adjust the two "Allow anon read" policies below if this project's other
-- launchpad_* tables use a different read policy convention.
